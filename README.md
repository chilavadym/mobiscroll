Elements
-----------------

#### Single and multiline text ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/inputs-fields))

Text fields are the backbone of every form. Use them to capture a wide range of properties from plain text to passwords.

Use labels, icons, placeholders or a combination of them to help users get meaning at a glance. Show/hide functionality built in for password fields.

#### Select styling ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/inputs-fields/select))

Similar to the single line input styling, it features a chevron/dropdown arrow to clearly signal the difference between select and text input.

#### Buttons ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/buttons))

Buttons with different states, styles and alignments. Inline or raised, left aligned, right aligned, centered or justified. Full-width buttons supported as well.

Use it with or without icons.

#### Segmented control ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/buttons/segmented))

Easily lay out two to five options for single and multiple select. Making all options instantly visible lets users make selections with a single interaction instead of at least 3 (tap to open select, do the select, hit set - like for the traditional dropdown).

#### Checkbox and checklist ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/toggle-radio))

Similar to the native checkbox in functionality, but with a look and feel that fits with the overall user experience and theme. Features description text, checkbox list and disabled styling.

Excellent choice for inline multi-select lists.

#### Radio button list ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/toggle-radio/radio-button))

Single select for a list of options. Use it instead of the segmented control if there are more items that would fit in a single line.

Usually a good choice for five options and above. Features disabled styling and optional description.

#### Switch ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/toggle-radio/switch))

Just like the checkbox, the switch lets users turn options on/off. Can be rendered as a list of fields, like the checkbox list or as a stand-alone control.

Features optional description and disabled styling.

#### Stepper ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/buttons/stepper))

When users need to make small adjustments to values by increasing or decreasing it avoid free-form input and dropdowns. Steppers help in minimizing mistakes, and reduce the number of taps for getting the values right.

#### Page and typography ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/styling))

Takes care of setting the background colors, spacing and typographic styling. It makes sure that the content you add shows up nicely on any screen-size.

#### Slider ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/slider-progress))

Work your way from a monotone, dropdown heavy form to an easily scannable page by switching controls. Consider using sliders for selecting one or multiple values from a range.

Continuous ranges, steps, floating value display, disabled styling and usage with icons is supported out of the box.

#### Progress ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/slider-progress/progress))

Provide visual feedback to the user. Reduce anxiety and help people understand progress with the control. You can also use it as a completness meter to show how the user does on completing a purchase.

With a powerful API control the state, value programtically and restart, pause it if you need to.

#### Alert, confirm and prompt ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/alerts-notifications))

Show alert messages, confirmation dialogs and prompt for focused value entry. With a platform-specific look and feel, you can make your users feel at home and communicate what they actually need to see.

These controls cannot be dismissed by pressing the overlay, avoiding closing it by mistake.

#### Toast and snackbar ([live example](https://demo.mobiscroll.com/alerts-notifications/notifications))

Keep your users up to date with notifications. Either in form of a toast or a snackbar.

You can optionally provide an action with the message - such as UNDO or RETRY - which will help the user make progress faster towards their goal.
